 * The tombstone case was only ever tested by handing `assertModerator` a
 * hand-built record, which cannot show you what the read path actually
 * produces — and what it produced was a throw. A soft-deleted row is invisible
 * to the deletedAt-filtered read, so ensureMember inserted, hit the user_id
 * unique index, re-read, saw nothing, and threw: every request that account
 * made 500'd forever, and the soft delete AGENTS.md mandates was unusable.
