 * There is still no Neon branch to run against, so the driver here is a stub
 * that records the SQL drizzle emits and answers with fixture rows. That proves
 * the shape of the request — open reports first, a real limit and offset — which
 * is exactly what was missing when a flood could push a genuine report off the
 * end of an unfiltered 200-row cap. It does not prove Postgres executes it as
